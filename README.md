# Lost in Translation: Modern Neural Networks Still Struggle With Small Realistic Image Transformations

This is the repository for the paper **"Lost in Translation: Modern Neural Networks Still Struggle With Small Realistic Image Transformations"** by Ofir Shifman and Yair Weiss.

You can read the current version of the paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07153). The paper has been accepted to [ECCV 2024](https://eccv.ecva.net/), and the final version will be available soon.

The repository is currently under construction. The code for the **Robust Inference by Crop Selection (RICS)** method will be added shortly. RICS is a simple method that can be proven to achieve any desired level of consistency in image processing.

Stay tuned for updates!
